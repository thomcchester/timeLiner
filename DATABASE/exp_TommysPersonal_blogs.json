I have created a server and temporary site for the creation of a Superuser and another pair for the creation of an admin user. Both of them are then pulled out of existence, not put back unless I boot it all up. You need the status of Admin to make any posts of any sort, and it checked on both ends. I am trying to be vague while explaining the best possible, not easy to do. "}]}}
